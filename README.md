# Between Life and Death
"Between Life and Death" is an Endless Runner style mobile game developed during GJ+Recife using the Short N' Addictive theme.

The game is divided into two phases: human and ghost. In the first one, he needs to dodge obstacles while collecting candies to get score and spend in the shop. In the second phase, the player will receive a new random challenge: confusion or inverted controls, he must dodge obstacles and look for his soul. If found, then he has a second chance, if not, game over.
